\description{
Finds the most suitable model for the NAWRU and the TFP trend according to 
  the BIC or the RMSE. The function computes the output gap based on the chosen models.
}
\details{
For \code{fast = TRUE}, the function pre-selects suitable models by applying the 
  following procedure: A HP-filtered trend is computed based on which the best trend and 
  cycle models are chosen according to the BIC. Also based on the HP trend, a variety of 
  different specifications for the second observation equation are estimated in a 
  univariate regression and the best models are selected via the BIC. The \code{nModels} 
  best models are subsequently estimated in the usual bivariate unobserved component 
  model. For \code{fast = FALSE}, a variety of models is estimated in the usual bivariate 
  unobserved component framework.

The input component \code{nawruPoss} is a list containing a (sub-) set of the 
  following components: 
  \describe{
  \item{maxCycleLag}{Maximum cycle lag included in the second observation equation.}
  \item{trend}{Trend model specification.}
  \item{cycle}{Cycle model specification.}
  \item{errorARmax}{Maximum autoregressive order of the error term in the second 
  observation equation.}
  \item{errorMAmax}{Maximum moving average order of the error term in the second 
  observation equation.}
  \item{type}{Type of Phillip's curve.}
  \item{exoNames}{Names of the exogenous variables potentially included in the Phillip's 
  curve (need to be included in the list of time series \code{tsl}).}
  \item{signal-to-noise}{Signal-to-noise ratio.}
  }

The input component \code{tfpPoss} is a list containing a (sub-) set of the 
  following components: 
  \describe{
  \item{maxCycleLag}{Maximum cycle lag included in the second observation equation.}
  \item{trend}{Trend model specification.}
  \item{cycle}{Cycle model specification.}
  \item{cubsARmax}{Maximum CUBS autoregressive order.}
  \item{errorARmax}{Maximum autoregressive order of the error term in the second 
  observation equation.}
  \item{errorMAmax}{Maximum moving average order of the error term in the second 
  observation equation.}
  \item{signal-to-noise}{Signal-to-noise ratio.}
  }

The list of time series \code{tsl} needs to have the following components 
 (plus those series included in the list component \code{exoNames} in \code{nawruPoss}):
\describe{
  \item{ur}{Unemployment rate.}
  \item{nulc}{Nominal Unit labor costs, if \code{type = "TKP"}.}
  \item{rulc}{Real unit labor costs, if \code{type = "NKP"}.}
  \item{tfp}{Total factor productivity.}
  \item{cubs}{Capacity utilization economic sentiment indicator.}
  \item{lfnd}{Labor force non-domestic (unit: 1000 persons).}
  \item{parts}{Participation rate.}
  \item{ahours}{Average hours worked (unit: hours).}
  \item{gdp}{Gross domestic product at constant prices (unit: bn National currency, code: OVGD).}
  \item{k}{Net capital stock at constant prices: total economy (unit: bn National currency, code: OKND).}
  \item{popw}{Population: 15 to 64 years (unit: 1000 persons, code: NPAN).}
  }

The set of tested models is extensive but not exhaustive. The best model is 
  solely based on convergence and the chosen criterion (RMSE or BIC). A manual check 
  of the results is highly recommended.

In some cases, more than \code{nModels} are checked. For instance, if a 
  re-parametrized and regular AR(2) process are options for the cycle.
